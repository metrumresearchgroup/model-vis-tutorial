The objective of this study was to provide a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
(PK/PD) analysis of moxifloxacin in patients with diabetic foot infections (DFI).
The plasma concentration-time courses were determined in 50 DFI patients on day 1
and 3 after intravenous moxifloxacin 400 mg once-daily. A two-compartment
population pharmacokinetic model was developed, identifying as covariates total
body weight on central and peripheral volume of distribution (V1, V2) and ideal
body weight on clearance (CL), respectively. For a 70 kg patient V1 was 68.1 L
(interindividual variability, CV: 27.4%), V2 44.6 L, and CL 12.1 L/h (25.6%).
Simulations were performed to calculate the probability of target attainment
(PTA) for Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens with fAUC/MIC targets of >= 30 
and â‰¥100, respectively. PTA was 0.68-1 for susceptible (MIC <= 0.5 mg/L according
to EUCAST) Gram-positive, but < 0.25 for Gram-negative pathogens with MIC
 >= 0.25 mg/L. With the exception of the first 24 hours of therapy, obesity affected
PTA only marginally. Pharmacokinetic parameters in DFI patients were similar to
those reported for healthy volunteers, indicating the appropriateness of the
standard dose of moxifloxacin. Overall clinical efficacy has been shown
previously, but PTA is limited in a subpopulation infected with formally
susceptible Gram-negative pathogens close to the EUCAST breakpoint.
